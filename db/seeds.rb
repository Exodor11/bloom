You can achieve this is by accumulating assets right at the start. However first thing is to correctly identify what is an asset. Asset is something tangible or otherwise which will cause net cash flow to you in future. So a fancy car, watch, phone etc are really not assets. Also when accumulating assets, you should keep in mind to not accumulate something which is speculative in nature and only way you can get some cashflow is by selling the same.",

		description: "A new technique will change this though",
		text_action_text: "An actively feeding black hole surrounds itself with a disk of hot gas and dust that flickers like a campfire. Astronomers have now found that monitoring changes in those flickers can reveal something that is notoriously hard to measure: the behemoth‚Äôs heft.<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new way to weigh black holes,‚Äù says astronomer Colin Burke of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. What‚Äôs more, the method could be used on <a>any astrophysical object with an accretion disk</a>, and may even help find elusive midsize black holes, researchers report in the Aug. 13 <em>Science</em>.<br>It‚Äôs not easy to measure a black hole‚Äôs mass. For one thing, the dark behemoths are notoriously difficult to see. But sometimes black holes reveal themselves when they eat. As gas and dust falls into a black hole, the material organizes into a disk that is heated to white-hot temperatures and can, in some cases, outshine all the stars in the galaxy combined.<br>Measuring the black hole‚Äôs diameter can reveal its mass using Einstein‚Äôs general theory of relativity. But only the globe-spanning Event Horizon Telescope has made this sort of measurement, and <a>for only one black hole</a> so far (<em>SN: 4/22/19</em>). Other black holes have been weighed via observations of their influence on the material around them, but that takes a lot of data and doesn‚Äôt work for every supermassive black hole.So, looking for another way, Burke and colleagues turned to accretion disks. Astronomers aren‚Äôt sure how black holes‚Äô disks flicker, but it seems like small changes in light combine to brighten or dim the entire disk over a given span of time. Previous research had hinted that the time it takes a disk to fade, brighten and fade again is related to the mass of its central black hole. But those claims were controversial, and didn‚Äôt cover the full range of black hole masses, Burke says.<br>So he and colleagues assembled observations of 67 actively feeding black holes with known masses. The behemoths spanned sizes from 10,000 to 10 billion solar masses. For the smallest of these black holes, the flickers changed on timescales of hours to weeks. Supermassive black holes with masses between 100 million and 10 billion solar masses flickered more slowly, every few hundred days.<br>‚ÄúThat gives us a hint that, okay, if this relation holds for small supermassive black holes and big ones, maybe it‚Äôs sort of a universal feature,‚Äù Burke says.",

If this is what it means to be misunderstood, then take your pick of the INxx‚Äôs. All 4 of these types, on average, go through long, intense periods of their early lives feeling completely misunderstood, lonely, and ostracized.<br>&nbsp;Out of all four INxx types, INTPs probably have the most difficult time getting over this, as they‚Äôre the least social of all 16 types, Fe-inferiors, etc. The biggest enemy of INTPs is stagnation. The whole cliche of the nerd that sits in a basement playing video games all day is born out of an actual psychology of stagnant, socially anxious INTPs that find nothing in the world really worth their efforts. I‚Äôve personally been there. That type of person suffers from a lot of judgment from themselves and others, and naturally will go long stretches of time feeling misunderstood because they‚Äôre doing nothing to connect with people in the first place.<br>&nbsp;The most intense feelings of feeling misunderstood probably are experienced by INFPs, as they often harbor deep fears surrounding their identity and authenticity. The great journey for INFPs is coming out and expressing themselves fully no matter how big of weirdos others wind up thinking they are. INFPs that don‚Äôt wind up hiding and feeling extremely misunderstood as they repress their identity out of fear.<br>2. Misunderstood means ‚Äúother people have trouble following their thinking processes.‚Äù<br>&nbsp;INxJs here, probably especially INFJs. Ni (introverted intuition) is the primary brain function that these types use, and it can be hard to follow. Ni makes unconscious leaps in its thought patterns.

Every European and North American city, and even small towns, seem to have a fitness gym. Gyms are one of the most pursued leisure places in Western societies and can be said to have established themselves as part of a white, middle-class culture.<br>&nbsp;In the UK, for example, almost 13% of the UK population is registered as members of a private health and fitness gym or a publicly-owned fitness facility, with London having the most registered users<br>Fitness gyms vary in location, membership fees and serve different social and economic milieus. Most urban gyms are located in the city centre and are at their busiest during lunch time and after work hours. In order to attract customers, most gyms offer more than a plain and functional working out environment but present themselves as lifestyle or family oriented places. Depending on the size and the target group, multi-purpose amenities encourage pre- or post-training activities, for example at their spas and beauty centres or they organize social activities at the weekend.<br>&nbsp;As notes, ‚Äúhybrid consumption‚Äù, that is, consumption of several goods and services within one single place, tends to extend the time spent by the customers there. Consequently, one may think that the more time gym users spend at their gym, the more they engage with its material and social environment, and the more they are affected by the same so that the gym becomes more than just a training site for them.",

		description: "AI is changing the game",
		text_action_text: "People have been asking this question since the beginning of the industrial revolution.<br>&nbsp;In the early 1800's the Luddites were protesting against mechanisation of the textile industry in England. Textiles were an important part of the UK economy and a major employer, so if even half of these jobs were lost there would be serious problems of unemployment and underemployment. The Luddites could not comprehend that the labour thus freed up would then be available to newly emerging industries, many of which didn't exist yet. A generation later, Britain was building the world's first railway network and ushering in a new age of transportation.<br>&nbsp;This is what progress looks like. You start from a position where fulfilling basic needs is labour intensive and you figure out how to meet those needs with less effort, following which labour and capital can move into new arenas. In a primitive economy nearly 100% of the population will be occupied producing food. After they mechanise agriculture, labour moves into manufacturing. When a small proportion of the workforce can produce all the cars and TVs you need, opportunities arise in service provision. As services become automated new services are invented. Two centuries of intensive automation and mechanisation has not led to high unemployment in developed countries.<br>People will always want other people to do things for them. As basic needs are met more and more easily, new ways of encouraging people to part with their money will be devised. Instead of ploughing fields, today's resources are increasingly devoted to areas such as healthcare.Where unemployment is high it is not because of automation, it is because of a failure of the financial system to provide capital to where it can be used to good effect. And ultimately capitalists don't like workers to be idle, because the unemployed don't consume as many of their products.<br>&nbsp;Of course, capitalism is not the only game in town. Marx had plenty of ideas about what automation meant and his view was that it would lead to super-abundance, a world in which capitalism became unnecessary. If you accept his analysis then automation is unequivocally good, as it leads more quickly to a situation where all of our needs are met and we can continue to the logical end-point of our societal development.<br>&nbsp;Either way, automation is not a threat to us. Either it lets us discover new industries and opportunities or it brings forward a time when we can retire in a communist utopia. What it won't do is lead to a situation where a few capitalists own all the machines and everyone else has nothing, because that is not a sustainable outcome.",
