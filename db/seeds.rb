		description: "Dedication, attention to detail and an instinct to do the opposite of what Steve Jobs might have done earn him that accolade",
		text_action_text: "THE TECHNOLOGY industry is littered with managers who have tried and failed to emulate successful founders. Think of <em>Steve Ballmer</em>, who succeeded Bill Gates at Microsoft, and Kevin Rollins, who took over from Michael Dell at Dell Technologies, who returned a few years later. Tim Cook heads the list of exceptions. Since he took the helm of Apple from Steve Jobs ten years ago, the firm‚Äôs market capitalisation has increased by more than $2trn. <strong>NO CHIEF EXECUTIVE</strong>&nbsp;in history has created as much total shareholder value. Mr Cook‚Äôs numbers beat the value generated by Jeff Bezos, who retired as Amazon‚Äôs chief executive in July, over his 24 years in charge. They also surpass the achievement of Warren Buffett, who has been running Berkshire Hathaway for nearly 45 years. During his second almost 14-year stint at Apple, Jobs added only $343.6bn to the firm‚Äôs market valuation, or $24.7bn a year.",
